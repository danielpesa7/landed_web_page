								<h3>Industrial Engineering Background</h3>
								<p>My professional journey began in the industrial sector, where I gained valuable experience in process optimization, quality management, and operational efficiency. This foundation has been instrumental in my transition to data engineering, as it provided me with a deep understanding of how data flows through organizational processes.</p>
								
								<h3>Transition to Data Engineering</h3>
								<p>The transition from industrial engineering to data engineering was a natural progression driven by my passion for technology and data-driven decision making. I recognized early on that the future of industrial processes would be heavily dependent on data analytics and automation.</p>
								
								<h3>Current Role & Responsibilities</h3>
								<p>As a Data Engineer, I focus on building robust data pipelines, ensuring data quality, and creating scalable solutions that enable organizations to leverage their data assets effectively. My industrial background gives me a unique perspective on how data should be structured and processed to support business operations.</p>
								
								<p>My experience spans across various domains including manufacturing optimization, process automation, and data infrastructure development. I've worked with teams to implement data-driven solutions that have significantly improved operational efficiency and decision-making processes.</p>
