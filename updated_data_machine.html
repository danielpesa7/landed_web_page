								<h3>My Journey into Data Science</h3>
								<p>Data Science has become one of the most exciting fields in technology, and my journey into this domain has been both challenging and rewarding. The ability to extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of data and use them to solve real-world problems is what drives my passion for this field.</p>
								
								<p>Knowing how to manipulate data, clean it, and make it valuable for machine learning models is a fundamental part of what Data Science teaches us. Getting to know how to use big amounts of data to make deep analysis is very attractive to me as an engineer - it is a good starting point for improving anything.</p>
								
								<h3>Machine Learning & AI Applications</h3>
								<p>My experience spans across various machine learning techniques, from traditional statistical methods to modern deep learning approaches. I've worked with supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics.</p>
								
								<p>The intersection of data engineering and machine learning is particularly fascinating, as it requires not only understanding the algorithms but also building the infrastructure to support ML workflows at scale.</p>

									<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
									<p>Since I heard the term "Artificial Intelligence" I started to read about it and tried to understand how it works. I wanted to learn what were the differences about the real AI and the one that Hollywood shows us. That was when I met the Machine Learning field and I started learning...</p>

									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>Python is the programming language where I learned all the Machine Learning and Data Science skills. Its friendly code structure and powerful machine learning libraries make Python the best language to perform huge and hard Machine Learning tasks.</p>
